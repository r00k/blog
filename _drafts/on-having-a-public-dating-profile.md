title: On Having A Public Dating Profile
layout: post
---

About a year ago, I realized something odd: my dating life was a secret to the internet.

While I had spent copious time writing and tweaking my dating profile on Hinge and Tinder, there was no internet-accessible place that told folks that I was single and might want to date them.

When I want to hire someone for my company, I make a lot of noise about it. I'll publish a job descrption, ask friends for referrals, tweet about it, and even pay someone to search for candidates.

But when I wanted to find a life partner I was being oddly secretive about it!

Somehow I had this vague sense that broadcasting you were single and looking for a partner was slightly shameful. It was something done quietly in the privacy of proprietary apps.

One day, something clicked in my brain and I realized how odd it was that my dating life had no landing page.

Once the idea was there, I had to try it. And thus, I created Ben's Public Dating Profile:

This page has been live for about a year, and the results have been quite positive. 

- thing to share publicly on twitter and IH
- lets people refer
- lets ladies vet (they all google!)
- I don't have to actively use apps




- IH ep link
- try not burying the lede; go right into profile

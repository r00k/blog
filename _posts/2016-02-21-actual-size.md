title: Actual Size

I needed an adhesive bandage today, so I went to the store and started the
"generic or not" debate between CVS' store brand and Band-Aid.

I was all set to go generic, but then Band-Aid clinched it: both boxes listed
dimensions, but Band-Aid's had a rendering with "actual size" beneath it.

It's easier to assess a picture than imagine written dimensions. Empathy won
the sale.

Two days before the call, send your VIP a nicely-formatted, ruthlessly-edited email.

Include the following:

1. Any context they need to help you.
2. One or two questions you'd like answered on the call.

Fifty good things happen when you do this, but here are top three:

1. You demonstrate tremendous respect for your VIP's time.
2. You give them a long time to consider your questions.
3. You make a great impression.

Bonus: they might just decide to answer you via email. Boom. One less meeting.

Four years ago, I wrote a substantial client-side application in JavaScript.

I deeply disenjoyed the experience, and I've avoided the language and client-side architecture ever since.

I was much happier working in Ruby, but ignoring JavaScript gave me some doubts. The language increased in popularity, and a small part of me was worried. "Is this how one becomes an obsolete developer?"

This simultaneous worry and disinterest persisted.

And then ClojureScript happened. And now Elm.

I don't think I'll ever need to write any JavaScript. Not by hand, at least.

Turns out I didn't miss _the_ boat, just _a_ boat. I couldn't be happier about it.

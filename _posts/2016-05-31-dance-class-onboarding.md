How my local dance studio onboards new students:

- Asked how I heard about them immediately
- First lesson free
- Coach calls the day before
- There is a discussion of goals/concerns before the lesson
- First lesson is short and super basic
- Demo of where you can get after 5-7 lessons
- Group classes for learning basic techniques / solo coaching for refining technique
- Polaroid with your name/face
- Consistent coach
- They suggest additional activities, like the social party thing
- Lesson -> Group Class -> Party
- Hand-in-hand linked walk to party(!!!)
- homework
- file with notes on me

<p>Today I learned that you can pass a block to Class.new, like so:</p>
<p>
  <code lang="ruby"><br />
    <p>
      klass = Class.new do<br />
        def self.speak<br />
          "hi!"<br />
        end<br />
      end<br />
    <p/>
    <p>
      >> klass.speak<br />
      => "hi!<br />
    </p>
  </code>
</p>
<p>This is a handy for creating one-off classes; the kind you'll throw away quickly. </p>
<p>It's likely that you'd do this during tests. Here's a test in active_support that uses this technique:</p>
<p><code lang="ruby"><br />
class ClassAttributeAccessorTest < Test::Unit::TestCase<br />
  def setup<br />
    @class = Class.new do<br />
      cattr_accessor :foo<br />
      cattr_accessor :bar,  :instance_writer => false<br />
      cattr_reader   :shaq, :instance_reader => false<br />
    end</p>
<p>    # Now grab an instance of our new class<br />
    @object = @class.new<br />
  end</p>
<p>  # Elided: tests that make sure the cattr_accessor method behaves</p>
<p>end<br />
</code></p>
<p>Another thing I picked up at the same time: you can pass a constant to Class.new and it will set that as the superclass:</p>
<p><code lang="ruby"><br />
>> klass = Class.new(String)<br />
=> #<class:0x105604658><br />
>> klass.superclass<br />
=> String<br />
</class:0x105604658></code></p>
<p>Here's another test from Rails. This one makes use of both tricks I just showed you:</p>
<p><code lang="ruby"><br />
  test "configuration is crystalizeable" do<br />
    parent = Class.new { include ActiveSupport::Configurable }<br />
    child  = Class.new(parent)</p>
<p>    # ...<br />
  end<br />
</code></p>

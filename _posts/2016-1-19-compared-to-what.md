## A different kind of index

A few years ago, I took a class in American Sign Language (ASL). In that class I learned an awesome new concept: [indexing](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/indexing.htm).

Let's say you and I were signing and I wanted to tell you about my new friend John.

If John were in the room, I'd just point to him when I wanted to refer to him. But let's say he's not.

Since this is the first time John has come up in conversation, I'd start by fingerspelling J-o-h-n, so you'd know his name. 

Just after spelling his name, I'd point to somewhere in front of me, usually off to my right. That point would then represent John for the rest of our conversation. If either of us wanted to refer to John, we'd simply point there.

If I then brought up a second person, Mary, I'd point somewhere off to my left, indexing her there.

We could then refer to John or Mary without respelling their names, simply by pointing right or left.

The places in space that Mary and John "occupy" are known as referrants, and the whole concept is known as indexing. In ASL, this idea replaces pronouns like "he", "she", and "it".

When I first learned this concept, it really tickled my brain. I loved discovering that language could vary in a dimension I'd never even considered.

## Building a plane

For the first part of my life, language had been a single point. I knew English, and nothing else. Everything I knew about language was things that were true about English.

I learned Spanish next, and discovered that some languages give every noun a gender. Madness!

My single point of knowledge had expanded into a line. On one side, English was like this. On the other, Spanish was like that.

Adding ASL gave me a third point. And suddenly, a plane.

Indexing showed me yet another way that languages could be different from each other. There was a whole new axis to consider, and it changed how I saw both English and Spanish.

## What does this mean for you?

In 2014, 6,000 students graduated from coding bootcamps.

In 2015, 16,000 did.

I wouldn't be surprised to see this number double this year, and again the year after that.

I believe we are about to experience a "baby boom" of programmers. New developers will enter the industry dramatically faster than old ones exit it, and the average amount of experience will steadily decline. 

(Don't worry, it'll all be fine.)

To these newer programmers, I say welcome! We're glad to have you. We've got a lot to do and need your help.

There's something you should know, though: if you only know one programming language, you should try to change that soon.

(By the way, Ruby, Python, and JavaScript are all so similar as to count as one language.)

Like me with English, you're likely to think the way your language works is simply how programming is done, without strengths or weaknesses. Your knowledge will form a single point, and you'll lack axes on which to evaluate your code.

If you're super new, don't worry about that. Breaking into the software industry is tough enough without dividing your efforts over multiple languages. But once you get your feet under you, I encourage you branch out. Learn a few languages that are unlike those you already know.

Many of you will begin with Ruby, Python, or JavaScript. If that's you, consider learning Clojure, to teach you can happen when your code is made of data. 

Then, perhaps Haskell, to experience functional programming at its purest.

Build things in these languages, but also deploy them. Ideally, build something that other people would miss if it went away. Toy projects are a good start, but you learn a different set of things about a language when you support it over time.

If you're up for it, teach others what you've learned and discover how much better you understand something once you teach it.

Finally, appreciate the nuance you can bring to programming language discussions. Think in strengths, weaknesses, and axes.

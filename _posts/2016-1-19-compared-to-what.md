## Building a plane

A few years ago, I took a class in American Sign Language.

The best thing I learned was the concept of [indexing](http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/indexing.htm).

Let's say you and I were signing and I wanted to tell you about my new friend John.

If John were in the room, I'd just point to him when I wanted to refer to him. But let's say he's not.

Since this is the first time John has come up in conversation, I'd start by fingerspelling J-o-h-n, so you'd know his name. 

Immediately after spelling his name, I'd point to somewhere in front of me, usually a bit to my right. That point would then represent John for the rest of our conversation. If either of us wanted to refer to John, we'd simply point there.

If I then brought up a second person, Mary, I'd point somewhere off to my left, indexing her there.

We could then refer to John or Mary without respelling their names, simply by pointing right or left.

The places in space that Mary and John "occupy" are known as referrants, and the whole concept is known as indexing. This idea replaces pronouns like "he", "she", and "it".

When I first learned this concept, it tickled my brain in such a delightful way. I loved discovering that language could vary in a dimension I'd never even considered.

For the first part of my life, language had been a single point. I knew English, and nothing else. Everything I knew about language was things that were true about English.

I learned Spanish next, and became aware that some languages use different verbs depending on how well you know the person you're speaking to.

My single point of knowledge had expanded into a line. Over here, English was like this. Over there, Spanish was like that.

Adding ASL gave me a third point. And suddenly, a plane.

Indexing showed me that there were entirely new ways that languages could be different from each other. There was a whole new axis to consider, and it changed how I saw both English and Spanish.

## To programming

In 2014, 6,000 students graduated from coding bootcamps.

In 2015, it was 16,000.

I wouldn't be surprised to see this number double this year, and again the year after that.

I believe we are about to experience a "baby boom" of programmers. New developers will enter the industry dramatically faster than old ones exit it, and the average amount of experience will steadily decline. 

To these newer programmers I say welcome. We're glad to have you. There's much to be built, and we need your help.

But please also know this: a programmer that only knows one language is a sad thing. (And by the way, if you learn Ruby and JavaScript, you still only know one "language.")

Like me with English, you're likely to think the way your language works is simply how programming is done, without strengths or weaknesses. Your knowledge will be a point, instead of a line or plane. You will lack axes on which to evaluate solutions.

So please, focus on a single language or two as you break into the industry. That alone is no small feat.

But once you get your feet under you, please branch out. I recommend Clojure, to teach you can happen when your code is made of data. And also Haskell, for its purity and type system.

Build things in these languages, and also deploy them. Ideally, build something in them that other people would miss if it went away. Toy projects are a good start, but you learn a different set of things about a language when you need to support it in production.

<p>I love Github.  We recently decided to become paid customers at work, and I'm tickled.</p>
<p>I also<em> </em>can't stand reading code on the site.</p>
<p>Why?  Frankly, the text is plain old ugly:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-51" title="before" src="assets/before1.png" alt="before" width="614" height="621" /></p>
<p>Those italicized comments look like faintly-etched glass.  And the bolded bits look clumsy as well (check out the 'm' on 'module')!</p>
<p>What's with the ugly?  Let's ask Firebug:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-52" title="firebug" src="assets/firebug.png" alt="firebug" width="504" height="98" /></p>
<p>'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono'?  Never heard of it.  Haven't got it installed.  If you're on Windows or OS X, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream_Vera">you probably don't either</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, so I haven't got Bitstream, so it looks like we're falling back t--oh my GOD it's COURIER.</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_%28typeface%29">Courier</a>.  Invented in the 1950s.  For typewriters.  I think I last used this font while editing <a href="http://www.jefflewis.net/archive/programming/gorilla.bas">GORILLA.BAS</a> to mess with the speed and gravity.  No one should be using Courier anymore (<a href="http://www.empirecontact.com/readability/Courier_font.html">unless you're writing a screenplay</a>).</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are two easy ways to fix this.  The first, you and I can do.  The second will have to be done by the Github guys.</p>
<p>What we can do: <strong>install Bitstream Vera Sans Mono.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dafont.com/bitstream-vera-mono.font">Download it here.</a></p>
<p>Installation is OS-specific, but I bet you can <a href="http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=&quot;install+font&quot;+linux+OR+os+x+OR+windows">figure it out</a>.</p>
<p>Here's how things look after the install:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-53" title="after" src="assets/after.png" alt="after" width="599" height="731" /></p>
<p>Sweet mystery of life at last I've found you!  This is about...a billion times more readable.</p>
<p>Now, the experience of not having their first-choice font shouldn't have been so painful.  If you're going to lead with a talented but fragile rookie, make sure you have a dependable second-string something something sports analogy.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Github guys <strong>should change 'Courier' to 'Courier New' in their stylesheet. </strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_%28typeface%29#Courier_New">Courier New</a> is an updated and refreshed grand-child of Courier, and it's far more readable, especially when bolded or italicized.  Plus it's just as widely installed as Courier.</p>
<p>Little change on our side.  Little change on their side.  Code looks beautiful; everyone's happy.</p>

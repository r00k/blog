<p>The best way to get better at programming is to pair with other developers.</p>

<p>Ideally, spend most of your time pairing with a more experienced programmer.</p>

<p>Other times, pair with someone less experienced. Attempting to justify your suggestions will reveal when your understanding of something is superficial. (When you discover this to be the case, <strong>admit it immediately.</strong>)</p>

<p>Pair program for much of your time, but do plenty of struggling on your own.</p>

<p>If you are the worst programmer at your company, that's great. Be aggressive in seeking to learn from your coworkers. Ignore the fear that you might be bothering them.</p>

<p><strong>If you are the best programmer at your company, quit.</strong> Just kidding; but make sure you don't stagnate. Reach outside your company for people from which to learn. Everyone should have at least one friend who is a better programmer than they are.</p>

<p>If your coworkers are dispassionate about programming, quit. But for real this time. Uncaring colleagues will sap your passion, which might be your most valuable resource.</p>

<p>If you can't pair with great programmers at work, do it at meetups or hackfests. If there are no meetups or hackfests near you, start one. <strong>If you can't find at least one person willing to join you, move.</strong></p>

<p>Open source provides an excellent path for improvement. At the very least, <strong>read lots of code</strong>. Try to figure out why it's hard or easy to understand. Contributing back to the project is even better.</p>

<p>When you write code on your own, get it reviewed by others. Notice the things that stronger programmers call out in your code (duplication, probably).</p>

<p>The best way to judge the quality of your code is to evaluate how hard it is to change later. When you struggle to make a change, pay extra attention and discover why. (It's usually because of duplication.)</p>

<p><strong>Try really, really hard to come up with good names for things.</strong></p>

<p>Conference talks are usually a lousy way to learn. Talking to other programmers at a conference is a great way.</p>

<p>Every programmer should read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0132350882/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0132350882&linkCode=as2&tag=codeulate-20"><em>Clean Code</em></a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201485672/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201485672&linkCode=as2&tag=codeulate-20"><em>Refactoring</em></a>, and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201633612/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201633612&linkCode=as2&tag=codeulate-20">Design Patterns</a></em>. Reread them regularly.</p>

<p>Don't get discouraged when you struggle. <strong>Programming is hard</strong>, and it humbles even the best regularly.</p>

<p>As you improve, share what you've learned so that others may find their way more easily. Pay it forward.</p>

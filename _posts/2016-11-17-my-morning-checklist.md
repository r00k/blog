title: The Checklist I Use To Start My Day
layout: post

I don't always start my day with a checklist, but the days where I do seem to go better.

To access my checklist, I run a shell alias I made called `start` which opens it opens it in Vim.

Here's what it looks like:

```
My Morning Checklist
====================

Sweep
-----

[ ] Close Slack / IRC / Messages
[ ] Enable Do Not Disturb
[ ] Process personal email inbox (remember 2-minute rule)
[ ] Process work email inbox (remember 2-minute rule)
[ ] Process Slack notifications
[ ] Check work calendar, anything pressing?

Process
-------

[ ] Process OmniFocus inbox (top to bottom)
[ ] Review all projects in Review tab

Start
-----

[ ] Switch to Work Hot perspective
[ ] If no items in Work Hot, go flag some things
[ ] Pick one and start working!
```

First, I sweep: I turn everything that might require action into an item in my todo software's inbox (I use [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus)).

Next, I process that inbox and review my current projects.

Then, I get to work.

## Some thoughts on individual items:

> Process personal email inbox (remember 2-minute rule)

I process my personal email first so I can get it off my mind. I work better when my personal life is in order. [Efficiency starts with a haircut](http://giantrobots.fm/208).

"Remember 2-minute rule" means any email I can deal with in under two minutes gets tackled immediately. This idea (and others that shape my checklist) are from the excellent [Getting Things Done](http://amzn.to/2f9zvqF).

If an email seems like it might require me to do something that will take more than 2 minutes, I forward it to a special address that creates an item for it in my OmniFocus inbox. I do this even if I'm not sure I'll do the thing the email represents.

I then archive the email. I don't like to leave emails around to represent todos. Todos go in OmniFocus, the sole source of what-I'm-going-to-do truth.

> Process OmniFocus inbox

One of my favorite OmniFocus features is its inbox.

The inbox is a holding area for things that I want to consider doing. I dump items into it using OmniFocus' macOS or iOS app, by telling Alexa, or by forwarding emails to a special address. 

After I've swept everything that might need attention into that inbox, I process it. I explicitly remind myself to process from top to bottom because it's tempting to go into cherry-picking mode. It's faster to just be robotic about it and work in order.

For each item, I do one of three things:

1. Delete it. Turns out I'm not going to do that!
2. Turn it into a single action: "Buy new Nalgene".
3. Promote it into a multi-step project: "Go skiing with friends". When I do this, I immediately come up with a first action for that project: "Send out [Doodle](http://doodle.com/) to find available dates".

Clearing the inbox feels amazing, by the way.

> Review all projects in Review tab

I check in on each of my project periodically to make sure a) I'm still going to do it, and b) it has a clear next action.

> Switch to Work Hot perspective

This is a customized view in OmniFocus which shows me only work tasks that have been flagged. I flag things when I want to tackle them in the next day or two.

> Pick one and start working!

This one's kinda important.

## Why do I use a checklist?

- It minimizes the number of choices I have to make at the start of my day. I find this lowers the barrier to getting my work started.
- If I want to build a new daily habit, I can just add it to the checklist! Since I've already built the habit to use my checklist, I can chain new behaviors on that habit for free. I stole this great idea from [BJ Fogg](http://tinyhabits.com/).
- It leaves me confident that I've swept, processed, and reviewed anything that needs it. It lets me start my day with a clear head and a confidence about what I should do first.

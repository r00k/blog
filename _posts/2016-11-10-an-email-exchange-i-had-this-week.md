title: An Email Exchange I Had This Week

_External consultant_: How about we start doing a weekly meeting?

_Me_: Will these just be updates on what you're doing? If so, can we do it via email? I'm happy to discuss back-and-forth things on a call but try to avoid update meetings.

_Him_: No problem! Happy to do it via email.

_Me_: (Hallelujah!)

A challenge for you: sometime soon, decline a meeting.
